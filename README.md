# Finding Palindrome Using Stack and Queue

In the C # programming language, using the Stack and Queue classes in the **System.Collections.Generic** domain name *(without using an array)*, the program finds out whether a statement is a palindrome.
## What is Palindrome?
 Expressions that are the same in writing and backward are called Palindrome. For example, the words 'level', 'madam', 'radar' are palindrome expressions.
